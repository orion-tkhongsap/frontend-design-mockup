# Product Requirements Document: Orion Frontend Mockup

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This PRD defines the requirements for creating comprehensive frontend mockups for **Orion**, an AI-first Financial Planning & Analysis (FP&A) web application designed to replace IBM TM1 Cognos. This document focuses exclusively on the user interface design and user experience, covering all six MVP phases in a single, cohesive mockup design system.

The mockups will demonstrate how users interact with financial reports, perform analysis, manage budgets, and leverage AI capabilities through an intuitive, modern web interface. No backend implementation is required at this stage - the focus is purely on frontend design and user interaction patterns.

2. **Improve upon TM1's user experience** by providing intuitive, modern interfaces that reduce the learning curve
3. **Design responsive layouts** that work seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
4. **Establish consistent design patterns** for data visualization, forms, navigation, and user interactions
5. **Demonstrate AI integration** through conversational UI and intelligent assistance features
6. **Enable self-service analytics** with drag-and-drop interfaces and customizable dashboards
7. **Streamline complex workflows** like budgeting, forecasting, and cost allocation through clear UI patterns
